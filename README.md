# Awesome Testing [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
> A curated list of testing software, extensions and resources

## Foreword
This is intended to be a curation of resources for the new among the software testing community. It is not tailored to a specific area (Usability/Performance) or role (Automation/Management). The idea is that you could hand this list to a CS graduate and it would greatly improve their testing skills, efficiency and overall breadth of knowledge. Note that this is for all areas of software testing after the code in question is written (no unit tests/static analysis!).

Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to add. Please read the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page and add to the list. :)
